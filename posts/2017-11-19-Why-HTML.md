If you are creating a content heavy app on Android, HTML and not native components will likely to be your best bet. Sure, native components give you the native look and feel but that comes at the cost of a lot more time.

* For textual content, if you need cross-referencing within the same view, native components will provide you none of it.
* Creating layouts using Android layout xml can be verbose. You will be specifying match-parent/wrap-content all over. 
* Specifying italics/bold within the same run of text is clumsy. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4623508/how-to-set-the-font-style-to-bold-italic-and-underlined-in-an-android-textview)
* Kotlin's layout DSL's can be concise, but their support isn't as comprehensive as even the native controls yet.
* Even if you decided to display the content using Java/Kotlin code, you would still need to somewhere store the content. Storing the content in HTML has an added benefit of being able to preview it, at least for checking the content itself.
* Accessibility, text-selection, copying etc come free with HTML displayed inside of a webview. A default TextView won't even let you select text.
* Libraries such as Bootstrap provide plenty of functionality which you get for free.
* With HTML, if you take your content to the web, you'll be ready in no time.
