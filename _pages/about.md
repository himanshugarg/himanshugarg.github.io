I've somehow survived tech for over 20 years, after first surviving 6 years of CS in college. Over these decades, I've been involved in Unix-to-Windows migrations, “teaching” CS, web app automation via the command line, software packaging tools, test automation, app maintenance, prototyping, documentation, SOC2 compliance, customer support, testing, AWS account admin, and backend development — using Perl, Python, JS, Shell, and SQL — languages that let me more things and quickly.
