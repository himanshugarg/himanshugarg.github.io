I unenrolled yesterday all the 5-6 courses on Coursera and Edx after enrolling in them only 2 days ago. I must have done this so many times earlier. Online courses never worked for me. But why do I enroll every time I have a few days on hand. The temptation of picking up a hot new skill, from your dream University or by a famous book’s author, is huge. The only courses I ever finished wiser were [Writing in the Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite), [Sharpened Visions: A Poetry Workshop](https://www.coursera.org/learn/poetry-workshop), [Programming Languages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). Here is what I think happened:-
1.	Perhaps my brain turns off when watching a screen as that is what it has been doing for over 4 decades with a TV screen.
2.	Well written books have continuity from one step to another. Videos don’t match it and perhaps can’t. It must have to do with the difficulty of creating a video and/or the difficulty of editing it. For deeply technical courses continuity is critical unless you can fill the gaps yourself. 
3.	Having learnt from books all my life, perhaps only books can make me learn.
These explain why I never did finish Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course. I must have enrolled in it half a dozen times already. While the videos were great, there was no textbook or notes.

So how did I finish the FP course in spite of it being deeply technical? Several things happened right with that course
1.	Even though the lectures were of top quality, they were supplemented by lengthy textbook style notes. With these in hand, the videos themselves became supplementary.
2.	I had a long held interest in the subject and had enough background to fill in the gaps left by the material. 

So when picking up a course online, consider these factors:-
1.	You have a deep interest and plenty of background on the subject, so much so that you have used the skills for fun and profit already. With so much background on a subject, don’t expect a 2 or 3 fold jump in your skills after the course.
2.	The course has a textbook to “supplement”.  And with a good textbook it is likely that the course will be a supplement to the textbook and can itself be skipped altogether.
3.	It is a [top rated](https://www.coursera.org/browse) course on Coursera. Avoid the trap of doing a course from your dream University, or from your favorite book author if it is not a top rated course.

Right now there are none that match. Until then goodbye Coursera!
