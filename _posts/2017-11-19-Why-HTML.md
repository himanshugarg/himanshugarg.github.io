If you are creating a content heavy app on Android, HTML and not native components will likely to be your best bet. 

* For textual content, if you need cross-referencing within the same view, native components will provide you none of it.
* Creating layouts using Android layout xml can be verbose. You will be specifying match-parent/wrap-content all over. 
* Kotlin's layout DSL's can be concise, but their support isn't as comprehensive as the native controls yet.
* Even if you were displaying the content using Java/Kotlin code, you would still somewhere store the content. Storing the content in HTML has an added benefit of being able to preview it.
* Accessibility, text-selection, copying etc come free with HTML displayed inside of a webview. A default TextView won't even let you select text.
* Libraries such as Bootstrap provide plenty of functionality which you get for free.
* With HTML, if you take your content to the web, you'll be ready in no time.
