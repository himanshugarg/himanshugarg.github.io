Should you enrol for that training? Short answer, NO. Long answer, do it only if:

1.	*Jobs* - It gives you **definite** access to jobs. So, top univs are okay if you are happy with spending 4 yrs of your life to get that one job.
2.	*Jobs* â€“ The training is highly relevant to your area of work. This has two benefits. It will help you do your job better. Second, you will not have to look hard to find opportunities to apply what you learnt.
3.  *Time* - Happens in your own time. Not when you are half asleep or fully busy. This rules out many of the live in-person trainings.
4.  *Time* - Isn't too long. Is a byte-sized chunk you can take home over a weekend.
5.  *Hands free* - If the training consists of hands-on exercises make sure there is adequate support available. Remember those Math tutorials that freaked you out because you were struggling with irrelvant details. When online, hands-on gets even worse. That's why there are those sandboxing platforms so you don't struggle with details "not-relevant" to the training material.
