It must have been around 8:00 pm when I came out of the Sector-52 metro station to catch a shared auto to home. Autos that went towards my home were few and filled up fast. Fortunately I quickly found one and boarded the back seat. There was another passenger already but it was too dark inside to see more than that. As the back seat is too small for three, following the etiquette for middle passenger I sat a little towards the front of it. In my decade long software engineering career I must have made thousands of rides in shared autos. Public transport, despite its discomforts, was less of hassle and money. This shared ride seemed special as I sat next to a young woman. This much I could easily tell from whatever little contact and visibility existed between us. The oncoming vehicles shed more light but sitting on the edge of the seat, her denims were all I could see.  Like any gentleman I readjusted myself to minimize her discomfort. Though I wish the journey lasted longer, it was less than 3 kms. She opened her backpack probably to pay to the driver the 10 Rs that it cost for the ride. The auto slowed down at the residential apartment before mine and she stepped out. It was hard to resist the temptation of looking at her when chance allowed and I gave in. I looked up at her and finally got a clearer view of him.
