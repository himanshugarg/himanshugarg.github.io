> In CorelDRAW 11, text is manipulated as a TextRange. Text ranges can be accessed via any of the following properties of Shape.Text:

> Frames collection - each TextFrame â€™s default member is a TextRange
which is the text within the frame

> Story - this is a TextRange containing all the text in all of the frames linked to the current Shape on all pages in the document
