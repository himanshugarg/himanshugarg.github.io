```
Don't worry about them,
When it's about you.
They will do a lot more of,
What they won't let you do.

They will trash your best work,
Without ever attempting any.
And still have the same ideas,
That they found in you silly.

They will ask you to do their work,
And leave yours to you.
And the ball will be most urgent,
When it is coming to you.

Their breaks will be well deserved,
But yours too many.
They will ask you to show up,
Without showing up in an emergency.

```
