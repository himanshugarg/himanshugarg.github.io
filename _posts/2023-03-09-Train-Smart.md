You don't have time on your side, you are lazy, lack motivation, and are uninterested. Should you then enrol for that training and also pay for it? Short answer, NO. Long answer, do it only if:

1.	*Jobs* - It gives you **definite** access to jobs. So, top univs are okay if you are happy with spending 4 yrs of your life to get that one job. Instead of finding that one job already.
2.	*Jobs* â€“ The training is highly relevant to your current area of work. This has two benefits. It will help you do your current job better. Second, you will not have to look hard to find opportunities to apply what you learnt. This rules out trainings for skills to land your next job in a new field. But see 1.
3.  *Time* - Happens in your own time. Not when you are half asleep or fully busy. This rules out many of the live in-person trainings.
4.  *Time* - Isn't too long. Is a byte-sized chunk you can take home over a weekend.
5.  *Hands free* - If the training consists of hands-on exercises make sure there is adequate support available. Remember those Math tutorials that freaked you out because you were struggling with irrelvant details. When online, hands-on gets even worse. That's why there are those sandboxing platforms so you don't struggle with details "not-relevant" to the training material.
