# Asistive Technologies for the Visually Impaired

The number of blind in India is estimated to reach [31M by 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11804362).

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology#Visual_impairments) mentions these assistive technologies for the visually impaired. Screen Readers are one of them

### Screen Readers

|| Linux | Android | Windows | iOS |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|In-built| | TalkBack | Narrator | |
|Others | | | | |

The screen readers read out the content an application exposes. If we focus only on content consumption applications (Why?) then HTML, PDF occupy [more than 80% documents](http://duff-johnson.com/2014/02/17/the-8-most-popular-document-formats-on-the-web/).

##### Browsers (HTML Content)

| Web | IE | Firefox |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | | Content read in reader mode |

##### Image Tagging (Images)
1. Facebook's automatic [alt-text](https://www.facebook.com/help/216219865403298?helpref=faq_content)

##### PDF
Accessing PDF's poses challenges when non-standard text encodings are used eg. in Indian Language NCERT Textbooks. Or when the text is actually an embedded image.
