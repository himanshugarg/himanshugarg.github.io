I have been between jobs for a few months now. In some ways it helped, because I could be with my family when they were hospitalized and when they were recovering. In many ways it didn't, because the next job is yet to be found. And then we were locked down for the past few months. Again, in some ways it helped, because I could help my kids with their homework. But, then again, in many ways it didn't because they didn't have access to the fun learning with friends inside a physical classroom. Fortunately, neither the job loss nor the pandemic affected, our access to world class Math learning. Its f*ee couldn't deter us. We didn't have much of a choice and the best things in life are anyway. Initially it did require some effort to switch from infinite scrolling to solving parenting problems. But we started with small rewards. And once we got into the habit of starting the day with 15-20 minutes of Khan Academy, we knew that this was the one thing we got right.

If you have kids at home who have needed help with Maths I am sure you have tried Khan Academy already. But if you haven't, don't let its f*ee or its use of English deter you. You could start watching the videos alone, if not together. But let your kids do the Math. Sit with them. Translate for them if needed. Give them blocks, beads, a notebook, a hint or whatever they need. And if in the end, you do have to solve it, remember to "Solve it like Sal".
