Lessons (not all learned) from failed projects

* Between two features to complete before meeting the client, I'd choose to meet the client.
* Between starting immediately vs starting later, I'd give it a few minutes now.
* Between compiling/running the code now or after this function/class, I'd check if I need to write the code.
* Between using a hot technology and a popular one, I'd choose the one I know best.
* Between a clean design and a poor one, I'd choose a functional one.
