Lessons (not all learned) from failed projects

* Today is a great time to meet the client, not when this feature is complete or when that feature is complete.
* Between a clean design and a poor design, I'd choose a functional one.
* Between compiling/running the code now or later, I'd choose now.
* Between using a hot technology and a popular one, I'd choose the one I know best.
* Between starting immediately vs starting later, I'd give it a few minutes now.
