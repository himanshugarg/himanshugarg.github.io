Lessons (not all learned) from failed projects

* Between two features to complete before meeting the client, choose to meet the client.
* Between starting immediately vs starting later, give it a few minutes now.
* Between compiling/running the code now or after this function or that class, check if you need to write the code.
* Between using a hot new technology and a popular one, choose the one you know best.
* Between a clean design and a dirty one, choose a functional one.
